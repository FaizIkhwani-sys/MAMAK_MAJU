TITLE : MAMAK MAJU ORDER SYSTEM

###**INTRODUCTION**###
We are developing an mobile application to change from manual ordering system to self ordering system when the customer wants to eat at mamak restaurant. This will helps the restaurant to have a systematic ordering system and data storing system so that they can track their data when they need it for example, customer’s order data. This system will reduce the workers needed for that restaurant and it will also make the ordering smooth because customers will have their own time to make order which will make the customer feels comfortable at the restaurant.
